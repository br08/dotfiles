# My dotfiles repo =]

This project was inspired by [holman/dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles). It started out as a fork, but then I wanted to make some changes and in the end I ended up with something different enough that I decided to create it as my own.

## Usage

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/br08/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
~/./.dotfiles/scripts/install.sh
```
